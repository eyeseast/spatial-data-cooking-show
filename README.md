# Spatial data cooking show

This is a demo project and template repository showing how I use SpatiaLite with Datasette for quick spatial analysis.

## Libraries included

- [datasette](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/)
- [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/)
- [geojson-to-sqlite](https://github.com/simonw/geojson-to-sqlite)
- [datasette-geojson](https://github.com/eyeseast/datasette-geojson)
- [datasette-geojson-map](https://github.com/eyeseast/datasette-geojson-map)
- [sqlite-colorbrewer](https://github.com/eyeseast/sqlite-colorbrewer)

Run `pipenv install` to create a virtual environment and get the latest version of everything. I also recommend installing [SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index).
